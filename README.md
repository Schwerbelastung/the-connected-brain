# My expectations & wishes for the course's contact sessions

## Concepts of interest


### General level 

Here's a list of general topics that are of interest to myself. Of course, not all of these can be actually done or experimented with in practice during this course's contact sessions!

Rank | Topic | Example URL (if applicable)
-----|--------------------|--------------------
1|**Modulating brain networks non-invasively**|[Improving working memory](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/316370.php)
2|**Modulating brain networks invasively**|[Kernel](http://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/bionics/new-startup-aims-to-commercialize-a-brain-prosthetic-to-improve-memory)
3|**Human Connectome Project**|[Official website](http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/)
4|**Applications of machine learning in brain connectivity**|(none)
5|**The role of neurotransmitters in brain connectivity**|(none)
6|**Brain computer interfaces**|(none)

As an interesting side note, here's a pic relevant to #2: modulating brain networks invasively. This is a concept that has been tested on mice over the past few years. :-)

The model aims to solve e.g., these problems:

1. Rigid electrodes can damage brain tissue. Nanoscale electrodes / transistors in a polymer mesh may be more gentle to neurons.
2. Rigid metal structures may encounter reduced performance over time, as the brain may create scar tissue around the electrode, which does not conduct electricity well.
3. Individual cells move along with heartbeat and breathing; a mesh that covers a larger volume can provide better tracking over time, when compared to a single electrode.

### On a more practical level

Now, those were somewhat general level concepts. What could we do during hands on sessions?

Rank | Topic | Elaboration
-----|--------------------|--------------------
1|**Different programming languages in neuroscience research**|Matlab vs. R vs. Python: what kind of practical applications are there with each of these, or others? How to prioritize learning?
2|**Resolution of computer-made models vs. fMRI imaging**|Different MRI machines have different imaging resolution. Presumably, with a powerful computer, we could *theoretically* make high resolution brain models that would model all the neurons in a fictional brain, even if we could not verify these models. But how accurate are the best fMRI devices nowadays? How many neurons are in a single voxel?
3|**Examples of brain connectivity scripts / algorithms**|What kind of algorithms and scripts do modern neuroscientists use? How important is it to be able to make your own?

## Concluding words

Looking forward to the course! :-)
